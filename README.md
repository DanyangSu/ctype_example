# ctype_example

Here I write an example that enables python to access c++ functions through ctype. ctype only work with c, but we can modify the c++ code and add `extern` so that ctype can indrectly access c++ class functions as well. This simple example illustrates the core steps. 

(to do)

add comments to code to explain how it works.
